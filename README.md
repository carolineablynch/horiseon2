# Horsieon Accessibility Project

## Live Site: 
https://carolineablynch.github.io/horiseon2

## Description:

Horsieon is a marketing firm that utilizes their website to highlight various marketing concepts. It is imperative that companies adhere to accessibility standards and their ask was to take the existing website and make it more accessible to users. To do this, I added alt text with the images, made sure the navigation at the top of the screen links to the relevant sections on the screen, and make sure that the underlying code was cleaner than I found it so that it can be easily read, understood and edited in the future. 

## Installation
You can access the finished site by going to https://carolineablynch.github.io/horiseon2. To access the code, you can go to github.com/carolineablynch/horiseon2, you can then download the code as a zip file or in SSH to edit in an IDE. 

## Usage
This website can be used to learn more about Horiseon's marketing capabilities. 

## Credits
I had a study-group with Esiena Ekwofia and Evan Chu to discuss the homework. I also utilized https://columbia.bootcampcontent.com/columbia-bootcamp/cu-nyc-fsf-pt-10-2020-u-c/tree/master/01-HTML-Git-CSS/04-Important/Good-README-Guide to learn how to structure a proper README.
